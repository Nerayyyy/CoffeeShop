## üîÑ Automatic Deployments

Vercel automatically deploys your site whenever you:
- Push to the `main` branch (production)
- Create a pull request (preview deployment)

---

## üìù Important Notes

- Make sure your `package.json` has the correct build script:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
  ```

- The `vercel.json` file is configured to handle React Router properly
- All routes will be handled by the React app for client-side routing

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Make sure there are no console errors locally

### 404 Errors on Routes
- The `vercel.json` configuration should handle this
- Make sure all routes redirect to `index.html`

### Missing Dependencies
- Run `npm install` locally to ensure all packages are installed
- Commit your `package-lock.json` file

---

## üéâ Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Test all routes on your live site
2. Set up a custom domain (optional)
3. Configure analytics (optional)
4. Set up continuous integration (optional)

Your site should be live at: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
